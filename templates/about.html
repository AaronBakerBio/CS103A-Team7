      <h1>Java Tool Suite</h1>
      <h2>Comment Generator</h2>
      <p>
        This tool generates basic comments for your code and attempts to
        accurately describe it in the scope of the program. I instructed gpt to
        remove the internal code. There is a weird issue that occurs in openai
        where if it isn't first instructed to strip the code you pass, it may
        modify your methods, variable names, and even method signatures in some
        cases. I have found that this way of doing it reduces the likelihood of
        this while testing.
      </p>
      <h2>Pseudocode Tool</h2>
      <p>
        This tool generates pseudocode according to the current parameters of
        Cosi 21a. I have not modified the prompt to properly handle more involved
        data structures such as BST's and Hashmaps so the pseudocode for those
        may not be Cosi21a compliant. This tool is useful for generating
        pseudocode to compare with what you have written, to confirm if your
        pseudocode is as it should be.
      </p>
      <h2>Method Description Tool</h2>
      <p>
        This tool generates a brief description of a method based on its name and
        parameters. It can help you to quickly understand what a method does
        without having to read through its code. Please note that the accuracy of
        the description may vary depending on the naming conventions and the
        complexity of the method.
