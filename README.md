# CS103A-Team7

Group project for CS 103A. Team Rue Lerner, Eugenio Sanchez Arguello, Aaron Baker, and Abraham Iberkleid.

### Project Goal:

#### Create a web app with `flask`, that hits the `Open AI API` and displays the response.

- Each team member has to create an html page in the `templates` folder.
- The html page should have a form and should use the input from this form to send a query to ChatGPT.
  (ex: a horror story maker which takes the name of the protagonist, the antagonist, and the plot as input. Then displays ChatGPT's response in the html. )

### Current Updates:

- Added a boilerplate `flask` web app to start from.
- Next step is querying `OpenAI API`.

### Past Updates:

- Meeting Tuesday March 14, 2023 19:00-19:30.
